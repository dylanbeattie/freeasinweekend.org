<blockquote id="hero">“Free beer and free speech are all very well... but a free weekend? That's something worth paying for.”</blockquote>
# tl,dr:

1. Companies use free and open source software to get rich. The folks maintaining that software don't get a share. That leads to stress and misery. Stressed, miserable people are vulnerable to social engineering attacks.
2. If NuGet charged $15/month, it could pay maintainers $0.001 per download. For the most popular projects on NuGet, that's well over $10K per month.
3. Charging a convenience fee for distributing free software isn't new. It's as old as the Red Hat Linux CD-ROMs you could buy in the 1990s.
4. WASI represents a new paradigm for publishing and distributing packages. It's a chance to do something different.
